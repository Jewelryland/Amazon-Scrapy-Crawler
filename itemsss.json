I've been using the product from past one month and have been thoroughly enjoying it. This is my first DSLR and so far my journey in photography has been tremendous. The camera is just amazing for beginners. If you intend to buy a DSLR, I suggest you buy this without thinking too much because this is not gonna let you down. The 24.1 Mpa resolution will blow you away. Fastest shutter speed of 1/4000 of a sec is sufficient enough to capture a racing car if you know the nity-gritty of the techniques. In a nutshell, the product's worth giving a shot.", "Needless to say, amazon's service was quite reliable and efficient.
